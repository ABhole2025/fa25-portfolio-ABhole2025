For our Intro to Fluid Mechanics class, we were placed into groups and assigned an object to disassemble and analyze from a fluid mechanics perspective. My group was assigned a lawn mower. Working together in a laboratory setting, we disassembled the mower to extract the engine and isolated the carburetor, which became the focus of our analysis. We then produced a video documenting our dissection process and fluid mechanical findings. 

I was heavily involved in the initial teardown, using power tools, handheld tools, and lubricant to successfully disassemble the engine and isolate the carburetor.
