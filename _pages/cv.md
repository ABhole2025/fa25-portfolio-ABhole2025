  *-Produced a technical video explaining engine operation at a 3rd-year ME level.*  
  - Key Achievement 1  
  - Key Achievement 2  

- **System Dynamics Teardown – Massage Gun (Fall 2025)**:  
  *-In a team of 4 students, disassembled a massage gun in a lab setting to identify all parts of its operating system and characterized it using system dynamics tools, creating a model of it.*  
  *-Wrote a technical report detailing analysis of this system.*
  - Key Achievement 1  
  - Key Achievement 2  

- **Mechanics of Materials Design Project – Torque Wrench Redesign (Fall 2025)**:  
  *-Used ANSYS to analyze stresses in an existing design of a torque wrench, and used CAD to redesign the torque wrench to better fulfil the required factor of safety and other requirements.*  
  - Key Achievement 1  
  - Key Achievement 2  

- **Cornell University Sustainable Design, Cornell University, Sustainable Mobility Project Team (Sept 2023-Present)**:  
  *-Work in a team with a professor and other graduate and undergraduate students to design a sustainable bus shelter for Ithaca’s bus network.*  
  - Design a structural module that can be connected to other identical modules to form a large structure, making for ease of manufacture and assembly, taking into account material and machining process to maximize sustainability.
  - Use an interdisciplinary approach involving Architecture, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Systems Engineering to ensure project meets technical and user requirements.
  - Connect with prospective users and stakeholders, as well as experts in the aforementioned fields to improve on design.
  - Preliminary Stress Analysis on system using simulation software such as ANSYS
  - Compiled a 128-page comprehensive report on all aspects of the project up to date with team members.
